# Lemonade App

## Overview
A simple android app that mimicks the juicing of a lemon.
Each state is triggered by the user tapping on the lemon, consequently changing the process until the lemonade has been formed.
Long tapping on the lemon shows the user the number of squeezes they made inorder to juice the lemon completely.

## What I learnt
* Responding to users tap on their phone through `SetOnClickListener` lambda function or long tapping using `SetOnLongClickListener` lambda function.
* Saving the state of the app when put in background or closed by the users.
* Transistioning between states and using Snackbars.
* Using Android ConstraintLayout.

## Building the App
This project was built using gradle 8.0.*
